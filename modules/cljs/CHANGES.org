Better error handling around the compilation - no breaking changes

*** 0.0.2

Breaking change - config structure changed significantly - please
check the README for further details.

The CLJS component is no longer based atop shadow-build (good though
it was!) because the official CLJS repository now supports everything
we need.

*** 0.0.1

Initial release, based atop [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-build][shadow-build]].
