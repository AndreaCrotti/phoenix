* Changelog
** 0.0.x
*** 0.0.2

Added ability to refer to configuration values in environment
variables. Thanks to [[https://github.com/glenjamin][Glen Mailer]] for the suggestion!

Made Phoenix accessible to people who don't use Leiningen by making
=(phoenix/init-phoenix!)= public. It now accepts something that can be
slurped (i.e. either =(io/file ...)= or =(io/resource ...)=), rather
than a path to a resource. Thanks to [[https://github.com/piranha][Alexander Solovyov]] for the
suggestion!

Fixed a bug with the config-file includes that didn't behave as
expected when config files were missing. Again, thanks to [[https://github.com/piranha][Alexander
Solovyov]] for letting me know!

*** 0.0.1

Initial release. Thanks to [[https://github.com/lsnape][Luke Snape]] and [[https://github.com/malcolmsparks][Malcolm Sparks]] for all of
their help and feedback!
